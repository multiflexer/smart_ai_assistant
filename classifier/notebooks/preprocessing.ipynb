had left a handful of voicemails i first spoke with xxxx on friday xxxxxxxx i told her about the multiple claims that were opened against an account i had since closed she claimed she only received two of the claims against the account after speaking with me she assured me she was going to  investigate  all the claims made that were made beginning at the end of xxxx on xxxxxxxx i noticed multiple payments being deducted from my chase checking account in the description all i saw were numbers on xxxxxxxx i called xxxx to see why money was being debited from my account of course all i got was xxxx s voicemail i left a message requesting a return call by xxxxxxxx i still had not received a return call i called xxxx once again because money was still being debited from my account this time i got a hold of xxxx her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd she told me that while they were  investigating  these open claims money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it finally on xxxxxxxx i received a voicemail from xxxx to call her as soon as possible i returned her call once school was dismissed for the day it was at that point that xxxx told me they closed their  investigation  of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision when asked what research they used to complete their  investigation  xxxx became short and told me i would have to subpoena the information at that point i hung up because i felt that it was a lose lose situation</td>\n","      <td>action company date group contact chase claim claim payment

to the original method of payment in five business days the original method of payment was a chase credit card that i had since closed on xxxxxxxx i sent a secure message to chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open chase cards i also followed up with a phone call that same week and the representative i spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase indicating that my  disputed charge  would remain on my account and  the merchant is not willing to credit your account  i followed up with a phone call to chase describing that this was a refund not a dispute the representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts i explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds they informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund i am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account on xxxxxxxx i sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails i received from the merchant about the refund  see attachment   on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase with similar language about  the merchant is not willing to credit your account  and  we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research   see attachment  on xxxxxxxx i followed up with the merchant xxxx xxxx requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds on xxxxxxxx the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded  see attachment  this was my last exchange trying to resolve this between the credit card or the merchant</td>\n","      <td>item pay credit card merchant estimate product shipment date item time cancel order item ship request refund

chase restricted my account by my debit card tuesday on thursday i went into a branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document this situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with me

xxxxxxxx i received an advertisement via email that new chase customers could get for opening a new chase total checking account with the set up direct deposit and an additional for new chase savings customers who open a chase savings account and deposit a total of or more in new money within business days and maintain a balance for days i careful read all of the disclosures and was sure to follow all steps correctly to be eligible for both offers to receive the combined offer i opened my accounts online on chase s website on xxxxxxxx to date  xxxxxxxx  i still have not received either offer despite numerous attempts to work with chase employees to resolve this  on xxxxxxxx i deposited into the savings account well within the business days of account opening  when i contacted chase at the  end of xxxx to discuss my concern i called the customer service line and spoke with a supervisor he informed me there was nothing he could do without the coupon code i explained i do not have the coupon code  at the time  and the call ended i later found the coupon code and called back during this call a lady informed me that regardless of having the coupon code there was nothing that could be done to investigateresolve this she then told me the reason i did not receive the bonus offers for opening either account is because i did not enter the coupon code at the time i opened the account online that was the only reason i did not receive the bonus amounts \\n\\nduring the online account opening process chase s website stated  if you open the account online your coupon code will be automatically applied  furthermore the email i received  will be attached for reference  specifically states  your coupon code will be automatically applied account  s  subject to approval  as a result two sources confirmed that the coupon code would be automatically applied therefore i dont recall entering the coupon because it was being added automatically for me \\n\\ni am very frustrated with my chase experience and the lack of payment of these bonus offers i rightfully earned after phone customer service supervisors told me there was nothing they could do i contacted local branch management they advised me to contact the phone customer service and said they could not help me i am very upset about this entire experience i want to be compensated to cover the and offers i should have earned i followed all of the terms and disclosures correctly please investigate this matter and contact me back thank you

the offer was xxxx rapid reward points and a companion pass after spending  xxxx in the first three months i followed a link provided to open the credit card now they are saying that the offer was over at the time and they have given me a much less valuable signup promotion that doesnt include the companion pass the companion pass was the entire reason we signedup and the reason the card was promoted to me they have informed me that the offer was from jan and that my cc shows approval on the xxxx xxxx the supervisor i spoke to said that they specifically dont send out offer details to confirm your offer when you sign up  thus denying me evidence  but also that they cant fix it without this evidence i feel that their offer and subsequent actions are fraudulent and constitute deceptive practices when i spoke to xxxx they acknowledged that it doesnt seem right but stated that chase is the one who has to authorize the deals so the error was definitely on their end

the card was activated and the transaction would process called the catering company and card was declined i then used my xxxx  xxxx card to pay for the order xxxx xxxx texted me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes contacted caterer and xxxx  xxxx was declined i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for hours called caterer  card declined use a mastercard  which processed went to use chase amazon at restaurant at xxxx pm tonight in the amount of it was declined i was told by chase i was not over limit still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the transaction never been declined by either chase or xxxx  xxxx before  today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear  it never did

of us with good credit like its going out of style be careful  the marketing is not clear if you already have a swa chase personal card do not apply for the new one online this has sent me through a xxxx triangle wasting my time and therefore money \\n\\nit appears in the middle of chase expanded their undisclosed rule to include all cobranded cards not just swa yet the marketing machine continues to ignore this policy and the agents on the phone are not well trained i am contacting the credit bureau bc two of the cards opened are not mine  that is the silver lining here \\n\\nhowever the issue with incessant marketing of their branded cards to customers plus this confusing rule and lack of agent phone training is false advertising the information is still relatively opaque as chase never comments on the rule but multiple reader and community data points suggest denials due to for cards previously exempt \\n\\ncfpb staff please help educate consumers and hold the big banks accountable for deceptive trade practices i do not believe this is intentional on chase s part but the second to last agent did encourage me to file a complaint here so be it \\n\\nthank you

property that i do not own or has any connection with me or my account \\n\\nthis left me in an escrow shortage and they have adjusted my monthly payment to reflect this as well i called to explain their mistake and they took two weeks but finally managed to remove the incorrect parcel from my account \\n\\nhowever they are not refunding the erroneous tax payment they made from my escrow account and are instead  waiting  for the local municipality to refund the money \\n\\nfrom my perspective chase without my immediate knowledge or permission has misappropriated funds from my escrow account and now i am stuck footing the bill until they get the money back

reported to the credit bureau that i was days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app \\n\\nadditionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats xxxx

different payments  security deposit and month rent  that was required to move into a rental i was supposed to move into on saturday xxxxxxxx the home owner then tried to get more money out of me and i finally pieced together i was being scammed \\n\\nsince xxxx was offered through my chase bank online portal i thought it was part of chase and i would be afforded protections \\n\\nafter i realized i was being scammed i contacted chase and got the run around finally ending up talking to xxxx in the chase claims dept  xxxx  i was told xxxx not a part of chase and since my payments were pier to pier there was no obligation on the part of chase to help get my money back xxxx said i should have read the fine print and xxxx should only be used to send money to people i know \\n\\nif that is the case then chase should have had an upfront notice stating  you are aware that scam artists and pirates prefer xxxx because theres no recourse after they get your money and chase doesnt care  \\n\\nive done a lot of research on xxxx since getting scammed and i think it is bs that chase chose to partner with xxxx the number one tool used by scam artists because theres basically no verification required to set up an account and that chase promotes it as their own internal payment system giving the illusion id be afforded the same protections i get with the other chase family of products \\n\\nim also very upset that chase made it this easy for this scam artist to now have my personal information

received a return call i called xxxx once again because money was still being debited from my account this time i got a hold of xxxx her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd she told me that while they were  investigating  these open claims money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it finally on xxxxxxxx i received a voicemail from xxxx to call her as soon as possible i returned her call once school was dismissed for the day it was at that point that xxxx told me they closed their  investigation  of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision when asked what research they used to complete their  investigation  xxxx became short and told me i would have to subpoena the information at that point i hung up because i felt that it was

early each month xxxx was the provider of xxxx to chase evidently xxxx was sold to xxxx on xxxx transferred the files and told xxxx that chase said i was bankrupt and to terminate the processes xxxx did and did not pay chase any longer i have received no communication from anyone on this i was going to open a checking account at chase today and noticed that my mortgage had not been paid i called and they said that xxxx will not pay them and have terminated me to bankruptcy which i am not in since the mortgage holder would know after much pain i was able to get a mortgage verification letter sent to xxxx so they can restart my payments however i had to make a complete payment pay late fees and have now late payments that will be on my credit file and payment history \\n\\nxxxx was negligent with the files transfer and xxxx was also negligent by not actually reading the date of the data and contacting the mortgage company to verify the sack of errant files that were delivered \\n\\nwhat can be done i have now marks on my credit report and had to pay fees for something that was done to me no one will give me the records although they are about me and my finances i thought that i am entitled to all records about myself \\n\\ni am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureaus and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run xxxx must have been really evil and xxxx doesnt really read what they are given or even contact the person xxxx did not let me know they were changing services \\n\\ni can provide only the mortgage verification from chase as the rest of the businesses refuse to provide written or electronic data they say that they only the computers transferred the files and were processed evidently

online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team

xxxx filed on cfpb \\n\\nthe original complaint was regarding a dispute detailed below \\n\\nmy laptop was stolen last year and someone used my information to book two flights from two different cities headed to the same destination i immediately disputed the transactions as soon as i got a notificationi filed the complaint within an hour of getting notification that flights have been booked on my credit card chase was extremely slow to respond and didnt do due diligence and contact the airline right away to cancel the flight and get me a refund \\nchase did a very poor job at investigating the incident and put the charges back on my credit card without doing a proper investigation when i asked i was told that i benefited from the transactions clearly i couldnt have flown from two different cities to the same destination later the airline also confirmed that i never took benefited from those flights chase asked me for a bunch of documents and i provided all the documents including the police report for the stolen laptop proof that the flights were booked under my name however the date of births used to book the flights were not mine clearly i couldnt have benefited from the services even if i wanted to \\nthe way chase handled the dispute was extremely poor and after multiple bad experiences and inability of chase to resolve disputes i am pretty positive that chase is horrible at resolving disputes \\ni am over that but this complaint i am filing is not about the original claimplease read below about this complaint \\n\\nplease read this carefully \\n\\nafter this incident i contacted xxxx and inquired about the flight they told me that they found too bookings for the same person headed to the same destination from two destinations and cancelled one of the bookings and issued a refund chase has not contacted xxxx once to resolve this issue xxxx has confirmed several times that they have issued me a refund and the money has been transferred to my bank account however chase hasnt issued me a refund whenever i contact chase they give me same old response the case has been closed i am not opening the same claim its a new complaint xxxx has issued me a refund and it hasnt been given to me by chase xxxx s customer service can not connect me to the accounting team and therefore it not possible for me to find the transaction and detailsthis is chase banks job connect with them and find out whats going on instead chase is asking me to contact xxxx and prove that the refund has been issued xxxx is telling me to have my bank contact their accounting department because its a banks job to resolve this issuesnow i am filing a new complaint demanding my money with interest and all the time chase has wasted \\ni am attaching the documents that xxxx has provided me chase has asked me to provide these documents its chase s job but i am doing this ob their behalf \\n\\nxxxx is clearly stating that the bank has the funds they have also provided me a document showing that transaction details that the refund was applied to my account \\n\\nplease issue me a refund i have done everything i could have please do not close my complaint without issuing me a refund that xxxx has issued a long time ago \\nenough is enough

and since it was before hours so i could cancel it and get a refund which is what supposed to post in my account in days and on xxxxxxxx i got the money back so i purchase another airline ticket with the same money that i got back but it was xxxx dollar and the money was taking out of my available balance on xxxxxxxx but it was saying pending on the statement but it was out of my available balance already on xxxxxxxx the xxxx dollar was taking again out of my account but showing in my account as it was only one charge  and i am not even able to see the first airline ticket or the refund on my statement because they said it was dropped charge like it was never happened but it did happenedthats not the first time this happened it did happened before but i usually get the money back after the weekend on monday but this time no it did got back  i tried calling them and they explaining but they only say one thing i dont see it on the statement so why i cant see my purchase for the first

purchase with xxxx xxxx xxxx on in the amount of i was charged twice for this transaction i placed a disputes case with chase bank on when i noticed the charge on my account i called back on sunday about the provisional credit for the charge and again on monday i was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided i used my debt card on monday then tried to use it again but it would not work i went to chase bank on xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity i was shocked because i had not reported fraud on my account i later found out that i was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from xxxx xxxx  xxxx i later contacted xxxx xxxx  xxxx again and was told that they did see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within days i contacted the chase disputes department again on monday xxxxxxxx and explained thaxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx would credit my account and that i did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim the escalation manager did not care and told me that chase decision on closing my account was final i had been a customer of chase for xxxx   years my character has been challenged by the disputes agents and i consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander \\n\\ni am not seeking to keep my account open with chase but i also do not want chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily \\n\\nonce again i do not want chase to have the checking account that i had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by chase \\n\\ni did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases

                                    \n","88   i preordered an item on xxxxxxxx and paid with a chase credit card the merchant xxxx xxxx gave an estimated product shipment date of  xxxxxxxx  after waiting for this item for a significant amount of time i decided to cancel the order as it did not appear that the item would ever be completed and shipped on xxxxxxxx i requested a refund from the merchant xxxx xxxx on xxxxxxxx the merchant stated that my order was cancelled and the refund would return to the original method of payment in five business days the original method of payment was a chase credit card that i had since closed on xxxxxxxx i sent a secure message to chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open chase cards i also followed up with a phone call that same week and the representative i spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase indicating that my  disputed charge  would remain on my account and  the merchant is not willing to credit your account  i followed up with a phone call to chase describing that this was a refund not a dispute the representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts i explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds they informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund i am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account on xxxxxxxx i sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails i received from the merchant about the refund  see attachment   on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase with similar language about  the merchant is not willing to credit your account  and  we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research   see attachment  on xxxxxxxx i followed up with the merchant xxxx xxxx requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds on xxxxxxxx the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded  see attachment  this was my last exchange trying to resolve this between the credit card or the merchant

\n","43   chase sent me an email today with the innocuous title  important information regarding changes to your chase account   they often use similar titles for ads and other communications  \\n\\nin it they force me into binding arbitration  despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them  \\n\\nthey do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences  many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out  and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out \\n\\nthis is blatant malpractice by chase

stated that what was purchased was not insurance but an agreement for chase auto finance to waive any deficiency in the event the vehicle was totaled chase auto finance agreed in writing for me to ship my vehicle to xxxx when i received military orders reassigning me to xxxx the letter explicitly authorized me to drive the vehicle here in xxxx while i am stationed overseas the vehicle was totaled in an accident now chase is refusing to honor the gap insurancewaiver provisions because the loss occurred outside of the united states or xxxx they are also refusing to release the lien on the vehicle so that the salvage value can be recovered and sent to the bank i simply want chase bank to honor its commitment to cover the deficiency between the insurance payout and the remaining balance on the loan  if the salvage value of is paid
